ECOSYSTEM Assignment
1. Develop a program to model a simulation of an ecosystem with various species of animals.
2. The program should have classes for animals, plants, and habitats.
3. Animals have a species name, energy level, and a list of habitats they can occupy.
4. Plants have a species name, energy level, and growth rate.
5. Habitats have a name and a list of plants and animals that occupy them.
6. The program should simulate the interactions between animals and plants, including: a. animals consuming plants for energy b. plants regrowing based on their growth rate c. animals moving from one habitat to another based on their energy level and the availability of food
7. The program should also simulate the effect of environmental factors, such as: a. seasonal changes that affect the growth rate of plants b. natural disasters that damage habitats and disrupt the populations of animals and plants
8. Use inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction to implement the program.
